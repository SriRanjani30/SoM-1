This is my continuation in learning java. The jar file has three programs namely frequencyCounter.java, ArrayListWordManipulation.java and NumberGuessingGame.java.
You have to execute the codes one by one as required using the following command in your terminal:
 -> java -cp Programs.jar frequencyCounter
 -> java -cp Programs.jar NumberGuessingGame
 -> java -cp Programs.jar ArrayListWordManipulation.

Here are some new things I have learned:
[^a-zA-Z ] - Except a-z, A-Z, spaces every other symbols will be removed which left the sentence with only words and spaces.

Arrays.asList(s.trim().split("\\s+")) - ".trim" this will remove all extra spaces in the start of the sentence and at end of the sentence. "\\s+" - this will remove all spaces inside the sentences including extra ones in between the words.
I am still at the beginning stage of hashmap and arraylist.
I revised the super for each loop which is a replacement to traditional for loop;
I also learned and implemented some improtant concepts in hashmap like looping each value of an hashmap through a for loop. for this we use hashmap.entrySet() to loop through each pair present inside the hashmap.
I also revised switch() in java and also the way of exiting switch using "return". Here the while loop keeps on executing until the user chooses the case with "return".
