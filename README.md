This is my continuation in learning java. The jar file has three programs namely frequencyCounter.java, ArrayListWordManipulation.java and NumberGuessingGame.java.
You have to execute the codes one by one as required using the following command in your terminal:
java -cp Programs.jar frequencyCounter
java -cp Programs.jar NumberGuessingGame
java -cp Programs.jar ArrayListWordManipulation.
